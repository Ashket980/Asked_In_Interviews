## Find the maximum difference between two array elements that satisfies the given constraints ##

**Given an integer array, find the maximum difference between two elements in it such that the smaller element appears before the larger element.**

    For example,

      Input:  { 2, 7, 9, 5, 1, 3, 5 }

      Output: The maximum difference is 7.

      The pair is (2, 9)
