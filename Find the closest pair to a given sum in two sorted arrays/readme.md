## Find the closest pair to a given sum in two sorted arrays ##

**Given two sorted arrays, find a pair whose sum is closest to a given sum where the pair consists of elements from each array.**

    For example,

      Input:
      first[] = { 1, 8, 10, 12 }
      second[] = { 2, 4, 9, 15 }
      target = 11

      Output: The closest pair is [1, 9]


      Input:
      first[] = { 10, 12, 15, 18, 20 }
      second[] = { 1, 4, 6, 8 }
      target = 22

      Output: The closest pair is [18, 4]
