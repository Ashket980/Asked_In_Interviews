## Print all triplets that form an arithmetic progression ##

**Given a sorted array of distinct positive integers, print all triplets that forms an 
arithmetic progression with an integral common difference.**

**An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between the consecutive 
terms is constant. For instance, sequence 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, â€¦ is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 2.**

    For example,

      Input:  A[] = { 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15 }

      Output:
      5 8 11
      9 12 15


      Input:  A[] = { 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 15 }

      Output:
      1 3 5
      1 5 9
      3 6 9
      1 8 15
      3 9 15
