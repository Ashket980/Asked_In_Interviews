## Rearrange an array with alternate high and low elements ##

**Given an integer array, rearrange it such that every second element becomes greater than its left and right elements. 
Assume no duplicate elements are present in the array.**

    For example,

      Input:  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
      Output: {1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6}

      Input:  {9, 6, 8, 3, 7}
      Output: {6, 9, 3, 8, 7}

      Input:  {6, 9, 2, 5, 1, 4}
      Output: {6, 9, 2, 5, 1, 4}
