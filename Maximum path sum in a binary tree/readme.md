## Maximum path sum in a binary tree ##

**Given a binary tree, write an efficient algorithm to find the maximum path sum between any two nodes in it. 
The path can start and end at any node in the tree and need not go through the root.**

**For example, the maximum sum path in the following binary tree is highlighted in green:**
