## Maximum Subarray Sum using Divide and Conquer ##

**Given an integer array, find the maximum sum among all subarrays possible.**

**The problem differs from the problem of finding the maximum subsequence sum. Unlike subsequences, 
subarrays are required to occupy consecutive positions within the original array.**


    For example,

      Input:  nums[] = [2, -4, *1, 9, -6, 7,* -3]

      Output: The maximum sum of the subarray is 11 (Marked in Green)
