## Replace every array element with the least greater element on its right ##

**Given an array of distinct integers, replace every element with the least greater element on its right or with -1 if there are no greater elements.**

    For example,

      Input:  { 10, 100, 93, 32, 35, 65, 80, 90, 94, 6 }

      Output: { 32, -1, 94, 35, 65, 80, 90, 94, -1, -1 }
