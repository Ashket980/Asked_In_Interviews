## Find a pair with a minimum absolute sum in an array ##

**Given a sorted integer array, find a pair in it having an absolute minimum sum.**

    For example,

      Input:  A = [-6, -5, -3, 0, 2, 4, 9]

      Output: Pair is (-5, 4)

      (-5, 4) = abs(-5 + 4) = abs(-1) = 1, which is minimum among all pairs.
