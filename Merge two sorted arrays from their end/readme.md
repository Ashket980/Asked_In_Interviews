## Merge two sorted arrays from their end##
 
 **Given two sorted integer arrays, merge them into a single array in decreasing order, and return it. In other words, merge two sorted arrays from their end.**
 
    For example,

      Input:
      X = [1, 3, 5]
      Y = [2, 6, 7]

      Output: [7, 6, 5, 3, 2, 1]


      Input:
      X = [1, 4, 7, 8]
      Y = [2, 3, 9]

      Output: [9, 8, 7, 4, 3, 2, 1]
