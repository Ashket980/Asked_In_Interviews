## Maximum Overlapping Intervals Problem ##

**Consider an event where a log register is maintained containing the guestâ€™s arrival and departure times. Given an array of arrival and departure times from entries in the log 
register, find the point when there were maximum guests present in the event.**

**Note that if an arrival and departure event coincides, the arrival time is preferred over the departure time**

    For example :
    
    Input:
    arrival = { 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 12 }
    departure = { 2, 7, 8, 12, 10, 15 }

    Output: Maximum number of guests is 3, present at time 7
