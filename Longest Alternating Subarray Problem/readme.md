## Longest Alternating Subarray Problem ##

**Given an array containing positive and negative elements, find a subarray with alternating positive and negative elements, and in which the subarray is as long as possible.**


**The Longest Alternating Subarray problem differs from the problem of finding the Longest Alternating subsequence. Unlike a subsequence, a subarray is required to occupy 
consecutive positions within the original array.**

      For example, consider array { 1, -2, 6, 4, -3, 2, -4, -3 }. The longest alternating subarray is { 4, -3, 2, -4 }. Note that the longest alternating subarray might not be unique.
