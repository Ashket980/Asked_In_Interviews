## In-place merge two sorted arrays ##

**Given two sorted arrays, X[] and Y[] of size m and n each, merge elements of X[] with elements of array Y[] by maintaining the sorted order, 
i.e., fill X[] with the first m smallest elements and fill Y[] with remaining elements.**

**Do the conversion in-place and without using any other data structure.**

    For example,

      Input:

      X[] = { 1, 4, 7, 8, 10 }
      Y[] = { 2, 3, 9 }

      Output:

      X[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 }
      Y[] = { 8, 9, 10 }
