## Find two duplicate elements in a limited range array (using XOR) ##

**Given an integer array of size n+2 containing elements between 1 and n with two element repeating, find both duplicate elements without using any extra memory in linear time.**

    For example,

      Input:  arr[] = [4, 3, 6, 5, 2, 4, 1, 1]

      Output: The duplicate elements are 1 and 4
