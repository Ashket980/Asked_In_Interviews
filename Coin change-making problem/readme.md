## Coin change-making problem ##

**Given an unlimited supply of coins of given denominations, find the minimum number of coins required to get the desired change.**

    For example, consider S = { 1, 3, 5, 7 }.

      If the desired change is 15, the minimum number of coins required is 3

      (7 + 7 + 1) or (5 + 5 + 5) or (3 + 5 + 7)


      If the desired change is 18, the minimum number of coins required is 4

      (7 + 7 + 3 + 1) or (5 + 5 + 5 + 3) or (7 + 5 + 5 + 1)
