## Find all odd occurring elements in an array having a limited range of elements ##

**Given an array having elements between 0 and 31, find elements that occur an odd number of times without using the extra space.**

    For example,

      Input:  { 5, 8, 2, 5, 8, 2, 8, 5, 1, 8, 2 }

      Output: The odd occurring elements are 5, 2, and 1

      **Explanation:**

      1 occurs once.
      2 and 5 occurs thrice.
      8 occurs four times.
