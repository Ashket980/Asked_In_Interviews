## Activity Selection Problem using Dynamic Programming ##

**Given a set of activities and the starting and finishing time of each activity, find the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person assuming that
a person can only work on a single activity at a time.**

**This problem is called the activity selection problem, which concerns the selection of non-conflicting activities to perform within a given time frame, given a set of 
activities each marked by a start and finish time.**


    For example,

    Input:
    {1, 4}, {3, 5}, {0, 6}, {5, 7}, {3, 8}, {5, 9}, {6, 10}, {8, 11}, {8, 12}, {2, 13}, {12, 14}

    Output:
    {1, 4}, {5, 7}, {8, 11}, {12, 14}
