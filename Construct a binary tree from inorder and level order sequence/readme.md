## Construct a binary tree from inorder and level order sequence ##

**Write an efficient algorithm to construct a binary tree from the given inorder and level order sequence.**

   For example,

  Input:

  Inorder Traversal     : { 4, 2, 5, 1, 6, 3, 7 }
  level order traversal : { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 }


  Output: Below binary tree
