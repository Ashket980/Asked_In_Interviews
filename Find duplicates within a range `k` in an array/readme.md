## Find duplicates within a range `k` in an array ##

**Given an array and a positive number k, check whether the array contains any duplicate elements within the range k. If k is more than the arrayâ€™s size, the solution should check for duplicates in the complete array.**

**Example :**

    Input:
    nums[] = { 5, 6, 8, 2, 4, 6, 9 }
    k = 4
    Output: Duplicates found
    (element 6 repeats at distance 4 which is <= k)


    Input:
    nums[] = { 5, 6, 8, 2, 4, 6, 9 }
    k = 2
    Output: No duplicates were found
    (element 6 repeats at distance 4 which is > k)


    Input:
    nums[] = { 1, 2, 3, 2, 1 }
    k = 7
    Output: Duplicates found
    (element 1 and 2 repeats at distance 4 and 2, respectively which are both <= k)
