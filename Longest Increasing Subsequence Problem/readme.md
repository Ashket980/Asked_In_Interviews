## Longest Increasing Subsequence Problem ##

**The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find a subsequence of a given sequence in which the subsequence’s elements are in sorted order, 
lowest to highest, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible. This subsequence is not necessarily contiguous or unique.**

    For example, consider the following subsequence:

    {0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15}

    The longest increasing subsequence is {0, 2, 6, 9, 11, 15} having length 6; the input sequence has no 7–member increasing 
    subsequences. The longest increasing subsequence in this example is not unique. For instance, {0, 4, 6, 9, 11, 15} and 
    {0, 4, 6, 9, 13, 15} are other increasing subsequences of equal length in the same input sequence.
