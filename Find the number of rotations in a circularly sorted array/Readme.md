## Find the number of rotations in a circularly sorted array ##

*Given a circularly sorted integer array, find the total number of times the array is rotated. 
Assume there are no duplicates in the array, and the rotation is in the anti-clockwise direction.*

    For example,

      Input:  nums = [8, 9, 10, 2, 5, 6]
      Output: The array is rotated 3 times


      Input:  nums = [2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]
      Output: The array is rotated 0 times
