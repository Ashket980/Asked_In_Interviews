## Find the minimum depth of a binary tree ##

**Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth. The minimum depth is the total number 
of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.**

For example, the minimum depth of the following binary tree is 3. The shortest path is 1 —> 3 —> 6.
