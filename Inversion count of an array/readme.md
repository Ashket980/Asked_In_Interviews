## Inversion count of an array ##


**Given an array, find the total number of inversions of it. If (i < j) and (A[i] > A[j]), 
then pair (i, j) is called an inversion of an array A. We need to count all such pairs in the array.**

    For example,

      Input:  A[] = [1, 9, 6, 4, 5]

      Output: The inversion count is 5

      There are 5 inversions in the array: (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 5), (6, 4), (6, 5)
