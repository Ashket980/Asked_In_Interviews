## Count occurrences of a number in a sorted array with duplicates ##

**Given a sorted integer array containing duplicates, count occurrences of a given number. 
If the element is not found in the array, report that as well.**

    For example,

      Input:  nums[] = [2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]
      target = 5

      Output: Target 5 occurs 3 times


      Input:  nums[] = [2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]
      target = 6

      Output: Target 6 occurs 2 times
