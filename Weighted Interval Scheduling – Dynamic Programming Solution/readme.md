## Weighted Interval Scheduling â€“ Dynamic Programming Solution ##

**Given a list of jobs where each job has a start and finish time, and a profit associated with it, find a maximum profit subset of non-overlapping jobs.**

**For example,** 
      
      consider the following jobs with their starting time, finishing time, and associated profit. The maximum profit is 80, and the jobs involved in the maximum profit are: (1, 4, 30) and (5, 9, 50).

        Job 1: (0, 6, 60)
        Job 2: (5, 9, 50)
        Job 3: (1, 4, 30)
        Job 4: (5, 7, 30)
        Job 5: (3, 5, 10)
        Job 6: (7, 8, 10)
