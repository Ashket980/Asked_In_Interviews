## Generate random input from an array according to given probabilities ##

**Write an algorithm to generate any one of the given n numbers according to given probabilities.**

**For example, consider the following integer array and their probabilities. The solution should return 1 with 30% probability, 
2 with 10% probability, 3 with 20% probability, and so on for every array element.**

    nums[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
    probability[] = { 30, 10, 20, 15, 25 };    // total probability should sum to 100%
