# Find inorder successor for the given key in a BST 

**Given a BST, find the inorder successor of a given key in it. If the given key does 
not lie in the BST, then return the next greater node (if any) present in the BST.**

An inorder successor of a node in the BST is the next node in the inorder sequence. For example, consider the following BST:

– The inorder successor of 8 is 10

– The inorder successor of 12 is 15

– The inorder successor of 25 does not exist.
