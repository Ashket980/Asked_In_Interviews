## Find all distinct combinations of a given length â€“ I##

**Given an integer array, find all distinct combinations of a given length k.**

    For example,

      Input:  {2, 3, 4}, k = 2
      Output: {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}


      Input:  {1, 2, 1}, k = 2
      Output: {1, 2}, {1, 1}, {2, 1}
     
    The program should print all the distinct combinations, while preserving the relative order of elements as they appear in the array.
