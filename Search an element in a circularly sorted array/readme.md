## Search an element in a circularly sorted array ##

**Given a circularly sorted integer array, search an element in it. 
Assume there are no duplicates in the array, and the rotation is in the anti-clockwise direction.**

    For example,

      Input:

      nums = [8, 9, 10, 2, 5, 6]
      target = 10

      Output: Element found at index 2


      Input:

      nums = [9, 10, 2, 5, 6, 8]
      target = 5

      Output: Element found at index 3
