# Construct a height-balanced BST from a sorted doubly linked list

**Given a sorted doubly linked list, in-place convert it into a height-balanced binary search tree (BST). 
The difference between the height of the left and right subtree for every node of a height-balanced BST is never greater than 1.**

**The conversion should be done such that the previous child pointer of a doubly-linked list node should act
as a left pointer for a binary tree node, and the next child pointer should act as the right pointer for a binary tree 
node. The conversion should also be done by only exchanging the pointers without allocating any memory for the BST nodes.**

**For example,**
