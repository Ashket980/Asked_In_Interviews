## Find two numbers with maximum sum formed by array digits ##

**Given an integer array between 0 and 9, find two numbers with maximum sum formed using all the array digits. The difference in the number of digits of the two numbers should be Â± 1.**

    For example,

      Input:  { 4, 6, 2, 7, 9, 8 }
      Output: The two numbers with maximum sum are 974 and 862


      Input:  { 9, 2, 5, 6, 0, 4 }
      Output: The two numbers with maximum sum are 952 and 640
