**Write code to print all combinations of positive integers in increasing order that sum to a given positive number.**

    For example,

      Input:  N = 3

      1 1 1
      1 2
      3

      Input:  N = 4

      1 1 1 1
      1 1 2
      1 3
      2 2
      4

      Input:  N = 5

      1 1 1 1 1
      1 1 1 2
      1 1 3
      1 2 2
      1 4
      2 3
