## Sort an array using Young tableau ##

**In this post, we will see how to sort N2 numbers in increasing order using an N × N Young tableau in O(N3) time.**

**An N × N Young tableau is an N × N matrix such that entries of each row are sorted from left to right and the entries of each column are sorted from top to bottom. 
Some entries of a Young tableau may be infinity, which indicates an empty entry. Thus, a Young tableau can be used to hold n <= N2 finite numbers.**
