## Find the index that divides an array into two non-empty subarrays with equal sum ##

** Given an integer array, find an index that divides it into two non-empty subarrays having an equal sum.**

**For example, consider array {-1, 6, 3, 1, -2, 3, 3}. The element 3 at index 2 divides it into two non-empty subarrays {-1, 6} and {1, -2, 3, 3} having the same sum. 
Please note that the problem specifically targets subarrays that are contiguous (i.e., occupy consecutive positions) and inherently maintains the order of elements.**
