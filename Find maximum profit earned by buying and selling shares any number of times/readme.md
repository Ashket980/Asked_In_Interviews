## Find maximum profit earned by buying and selling shares any number of times ##

**Given a list containing future prediction of share prices, find the maximum profit earned by buying and selling shares any number of times with the constraint, 
a new transaction can only start after the previous transaction is complete, i.e., we can only hold at most one share at a time.**

    For example,

      Stock Prices: {1, 5, 2, 3, 7, 6, 4, 5}

      Total profit earned is 10

      Buy on day 1 and sell on day 2
      Buy on day 3 and sell on day 5
      Buy on day 7 and sell on day 8


      Stock Prices: {10, 8, 6, 5, 4, 2}

      Total profit earned is 0
