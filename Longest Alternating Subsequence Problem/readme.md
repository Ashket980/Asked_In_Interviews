## Longest Alternating Subsequence Problem ##

**The longest alternating subsequence is a problem of finding a subsequence of a given sequence in which the elements are in 
alternating order and in which the sequence is as long as possible. In order words, we need to find the length of the longest 
subsequence with alternate low and high elements.**

    For example, consider array A[] = [8, 9, 6, 4, 5, 7, 3, 2, 4]. The longest alternating subsequence length is 6, and the subsequence is 
    [8, 9, 6, 7, 3, 4] as (8 < 9 > 6 < 7 > 3 < 4).

      Note that the longest alternating subsequence is not unique. Following are a few more subsequences of length 6:

      (8, 9, 6, 7, 2, 4)
      (8, 9, 4, 7, 3, 4)
      (8, 9, 4, 7, 2, 4)
      …
      …
      And many more…
