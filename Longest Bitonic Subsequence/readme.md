## Longest Bitonic Subsequence ##

**The longest bitonic subsequence problem is to find a subsequence of a given sequence in which the subsequence’s 
elements are first sorted in increasing order, then in decreasing order, and the subsequence is as long as possible.**

    For example, the longest bitonic subsequence of a sequence [4, 2, 5, 9, 7, 6, 10, 3, 1] is [4, 5, 9, 7, 6, 3, 1].

      For sequences sorted in increasing or decreasing order, the output is the same as the input sequence, i.e.,

      [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] ——> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] ——> [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
