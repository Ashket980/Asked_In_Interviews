## Find the next greater element for every array element ##

**Given an integer array, find the next greater element for every array element. The next greater element of a number x is the first greater number to the right of x in the array.**


**In other words, for each element A[i] in the array A, find an element A[j] such that j > i and A[j] > A[i] and the value of j should be as minimum as possible. If the next 
greater element doesnâ€™t exist in the array for any element, consider it -1.**

**Example**

    Input:  [2, 7, 3, 5, 4, 6, 8]
    Output: [7, 8, 5, 6, 6, 8, -1]


    Input:  [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
    Output: [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]


    Note that the next greater element for the last array element is always -1.
