## Find the sorted triplet in an array ##

**Given an integer array A, efficiently find a sorted triplet such that A[i] < A[j] < A[k] and 0 <= i < j < k < n, where n is the array size.**

**For example,**

    Input:  A[] = { 5, 4, 3, 7, 6, 1, 9 }
 
    Output: Any one of the following triplets:
    (5, 7, 9)
    (4, 7, 9)
    (3, 7, 9)
    (5, 6, 9)
    (4, 6, 9)
    (3, 6, 9)
