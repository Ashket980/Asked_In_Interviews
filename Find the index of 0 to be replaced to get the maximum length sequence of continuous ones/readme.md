## Find the index of 0 to be replaced to get the maximum length sequence of continuous ones ##

**Given a binary array, find the index of 0 to be replaced with 1 to get the maximum length sequence of continuous ones.**

    For example, consider the array { 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1 }. We need to replace index 7 to get the continuous sequence of length 6 containing all 1â€™s.
