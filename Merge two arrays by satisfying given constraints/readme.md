## Merge two arrays by satisfying given constraints ##

**Given two sorted arrays X[] and Y[] of size m and n each where m >= n and X[] has exactly n vacant cells, 
merge elements of Y[] in their correct position in array X[], i.e., merge (X, Y) by keeping the sorted order.**

    For example,

      Input:

      X[] = { 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 5, 6, 0, 0 }
      Y[] = { 1, 8, 9, 10, 15 }

      The vacant cells in X[] is represented by 0

      Output:

      X[] = { 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 15 }
